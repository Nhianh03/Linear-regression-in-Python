# Linear-regression-in-Python
**Linear Regression works well when:**

✅ The data has a linear relationship between X and Y .

✅ There are not too many outliers that distort the model.

✅ The input variables do not have too many strong correlations with each other (multicollinearity).

Conversely, if the data tends to be non-linear, more complex models such as Polynomial Regression or other non-linear models may be needed.
